# ClashRoyale
A .NET Core Clash Royale Server (v1.9) using DotNetty

## Battles
The server supports battles, for those a patched client is neccessary.

## Need help?
Contact me on Discord (Incredible#2109) or open an issue.

### Friendly remind:
It's opensourced with GPL license. Anything that will pop which use any part of the logic contained in this repo, will be forced to release opensource. Instead of wasting time working on thousand private shits, build one great together!
